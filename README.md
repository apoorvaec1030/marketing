## **MMM Secrets: What Really Drives Your Marketing ROI? (Hint: It’s Not Just Ad Spend!)**  

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is making a comeback as cookies disappear and tracking gets tougher. But here’s the catch—**your model is only as good as your features!** If you’re building MMM for a social media platform, make sure you’re looking beyond just paid ads. Here are some must-have features (with examples!):  

### **1. Media & Advertising** – Because ads don’t work in isolation  
- **Paid Social Spend (TikTok, Meta, YouTube, X):** Are higher ad budgets actually driving more conversions, or just inflating CPMs?  
- **Paid Search (Google Ads, Bing):** Do branded searches spike after running social media ads, or are users finding you another way?  
- **TV, Radio, Print:** Did that expensive TV spot drive sales, or just make your brand more recognizable?  

### **2. Organic & Platform-Specific Factors** – Sometimes, free works better than paid  
- **Organic Social Engagement (Shares, Likes, Comments):** Is virality leading to real revenue, or just boosting vanity metrics?  
- **Influencer & UGC Impact:** Does a product mention from a creator translate to purchases, or just more followers?  
- **Algorithmic Boosts (Trending Page, Explore Feeds):** How much does appearing on TikTok’s For You Page amplify organic reach?  

### **3. External & Market Factors** – Because context is everything  
- **Seasonality & Holidays:** Do Black Friday campaigns increase revenue, or do they just pull sales forward?  
- **Competitor Spend & Activity:** Are your conversions dropping because a competitor just doubled their ad budget?  
- **Economic Indicators (CPI, Interest Rates):** Are consumers holding back on spending due to economic downturns?  

### **4. Owned Marketing & CRM** – Don’t ignore what you already control  
- **Email & Push Notifications:** Are these nudging conversions, or just causing unsubscribes?  
- **Loyalty & Referral Programs:** Are they keeping high-value customers engaged, or just offering discounts to those who would have purchased anyway?  
- **Discount & Promotion Impact:** Are promotions driving new demand, or just training customers to wait for sales?  

### **5. Brand & Virality Signals** – Because buzz matters  
- **Search Volume (Brand & Category):** If searches spike, is it because of marketing, word-of-mouth, or a controversy?  
- **Sentiment Analysis (Social Listening):** Are people talking about your brand for the right reasons?  
- **PR & Word of Mouth Effects:** Do press mentions and social buzz convert to actual revenue?  

### **The Bottom Line:**  
MMM isn’t just about ad spend. **A great model captures the entire marketing ecosystem.**
