This script sets up a simple Marketing Mix Model (MMM) for TikTok, estimating the impact of various marketing channels on conversions. It includes:

Data simulation for spend across different channels (TV, social media, search ads, influencers).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn.
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to estimate channel effectiveness.
Prediction visualization to compare actual vs. predicted conversions.

I've added a media saturation effect using a diminishing returns function, which applies non-linear scaling to marketing spend.
